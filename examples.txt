// EXAMPLE QUESTIONS for the Gapfill Quick import filter
// Read more about it here
// https://github.com/marcusgreen/moodle-qformat_gapfill_quick/wiki
// by Marcus Green  Oct 2015. Handy for creating multiple
// questions with slight variations.
// This is the simplest example, which will create
// a question with the question text as the name
// and have two gaps with draggables of cat and mat 
// Not very useful but shows the basics.

//All questions will go in this category 

$CATEGORY: GapfillQuickFormatImport

The [cat] sat on the [mat]

// A more realistic example is where you would
// create the same question twice, one with draggable 
// options and the other as plain fill in the gaps.


::CatMatDragDrop::The [cat] sat on the [mat]
//This version has a gap with no draggable prompts

::CatMatDragGapfill::The [cat] sat on the [mat] {gapfill}

// Here is an example with two variations testing the same idea
::PluralCat:: The plural for cat is [cats] {gapfill}

::PluralSheep:: The plural for sheep is [sheep] {gapfill}
